# Project Overview

This project is a Python-based RESTful API for astrological calculations. It is built using the FastAPI framework and leverages the `kerykeion` library for its core astrological features. The API provides a variety of endpoints for generating natal charts, synastry charts, transit charts, and other astrological data. It also includes a simple frontend to interact with the API.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11
*   Pipenv

### Installation

1.  Install the required dependencies using Pipenv:

    ```bash
    pipenv install --dev
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
pipenv run dev
```

This will start the server with auto-reloading and debug logging enabled. The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
pipenv run test
```

For more verbose output, you can use:

```bash
pipenv run test-verbose
```

## Development Conventions

### Code Style

This project uses the `black` code formatter to maintain a consistent code style. To format the code, run the following command:

```bash
pipenv run format
```

### Type Checking

This project uses `mypy` for static type checking. To check the types, run the following command:

```bash
pipenv run quality
```

### API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and is available at the following endpoints when the server is running:

*   **Swagger UI:** `/docs`
*   **ReDoc:** `/redoc`

The OpenAPI schema is also available at `/openapi.json`. You can also generate the schema by running:

```bash
pipenv run schema
```
